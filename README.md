A Babel plugin which automatically makes stack traces source-map aware

# INSTALL

    npm install babel-plugin-source-map-support

# SYNOPSIS

`$ cat test.js`

```javascript
import foo from 'foo';
import bar from 'bar';

test();
```

`$ babel --plugins source-map-support test.js`

```javascript
import 'source-map-support/register';
import foo from 'foo';
import bar from 'bar';

test();
```

# DESCRIPTION

This is a [Babel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel) [plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/advanced/plugins/)
which prepends the following statement to source files:

```javascript
import 'source-map-support/register';
```

In conjunction with the [source-map-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support)
module, **which must be installed separately**, this statement hooks into the v8 stack-trace API to
translate call sites in the transpiled code back to their corresponding locations in
the original code.

Note: this only works in environments which support the v8 stack-trace API (e.g. Node.js and Chrome),
though it's harmless in other environments.

The source-map-support module only needs to be registered in the top-level file(s) of an application,
but it no-ops if it has already been loaded, so there is no harm in registering it in every file.

## CAVEATS

Source maps must currently be inline. While the source-map-support module provides a way
to associate a file with an external source map, that is not currently supported by
this plugin.

# DEVELOPMENT

## NPM Scripts

The following NPM scripts are available:

* build - compile the plugin and save it to the target directory
* test - compile the plugin and run the test suite
* test:build - compile the plugin and run the test suite in debug mode (which dumps each transformed test case)

## Gulp tasks

The following Gulp tasks are available:

* build - compile the plugin and save it to the target directory
* clean - remove the target directory and its contents
* default - alias for the `build` task
